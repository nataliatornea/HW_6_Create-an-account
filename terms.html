    <h2>Terms and Conditions:</h2>
        <p>Terms and Conditions can be defined as “Special and general arrangements, rules, 
        requirements, standards etc. forming integral parts of a contract or agreement.” <br>
        We take it to be a single concept but in reality it is made up of two words ‘terms’ 
        and ‘conditions’ which are different and separate. Terms are basically things that 
        we agree to do or not to do. Conditions are things that must be satisfied before the 
        transaction becomes binding upon the two parties. <br></p>
        <p>We recommend using Terms and Conditions when promoting via the various types of reward 
        & loyalty programs and other various offers noted above to ensure that the participant 
        is totally aware of all that is expected of them by participating as well as the consequences 
        involved if the participant does not abide by the conditions set forth therein. <br>
        If you want Marden-Kane to author your Official Rules or Terms and Conditions, contact us for 
        immediate assistance – we have the experience and the know-how.</p>
